# Redirector Plugin for [DocPad](https://docpad.org)


[DocPad](https://docpad.org) plugin for redirecting URLs to other websites via config. Based on [clean urls](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-cleanurls) and [Base](https://github.com/bevry/base).

## Install

```
docpad install redirector
```


## Usage/Configure

Creates 301 redirects for non-static environments.

Creates html files at the source urls with 0-second meta refresh tags pointing to the destination url for static environments. Creates a directory with an `index.html` file if the source url does not end in `.html` (e.g. `somelink` will be generated as `somelink/index.html`). 

You can tell docpad to use the static environment by adding `--env static` to the end of your DocPad command, so to perform a one off generation for a static environment you'll run `docpad generate --env static`, to perform your usual generate, serve and watch it'll be `docpad run --env static`.

``` coffee
    plugins:
        redirector:
            redirects: 
                # source: destination
                "project/": "http://new-site.com/"
                "project/info.html": "http://new-site.com/new-info-page"
```

Currently, this plugin only supports one-to-one redirects, and only to off-site URLs. To redirect to URLs on your website, use the [clean urls](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-cleanurls) plugin. (You can use both cleanurls and redirector at the same time.)

Wildcards and regular expressions are not supported.
